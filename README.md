# vim config

This is my vim config.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## installation

first, clone the repo:

``` ➜  ~ git clone https://github.com/adamenger/vim.git````

symlink to ~/.vimrc

``` ➜  ~ ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc```

then run install script:

``` ➜ ~/.vim/./install.sh ```
